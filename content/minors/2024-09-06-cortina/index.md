Situated in the Dolomites of Italy, Cortina dâ€™Ampezzo hosted the 1956 Winter Olympics. When visiting the town in 2024, we discovered the old ramp used for ski jumping. While far from being an expert, I believe the ramp is not in use anymore. I particularly liked the twist of repurposing of the landing strip into a local football field.
