My takes during a walk on the one and only ‘yellow bridge’ of Rotterdam – on a serene and sunny early spring morning.

For those who don’t know about this remarkable piece of public infrastructure, it’s essentially a octopus-like pedestrian high-way that connects three districts in the center of Rotterdam.
