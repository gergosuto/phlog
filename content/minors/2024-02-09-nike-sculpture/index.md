Nike was goddess of victory in ancient Greece. This sculpture of her was first erected in the Agora of Athens around 425 BC. Originally carved as winged on her back, a typical representation of Nike, she has lost her wings at some point over the millenia. In this photo, I attempted to create an illusion for this irreplacable loss using the light and shadows of the setting sun in Athens.
