Owing to its architecture, decorations, and location in the heart of Athens, the Parthenon is a major cultural symbol of Greece. While any building aged 2500 years would happily be in the condition of the Parthenon, it has certainly lost some of its beauty over the years; damages caused both by nature and humans. These three frames are my reflections on the present state and remaining grace of this ancient masterpiece.
