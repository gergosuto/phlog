I use photography as a tool for self-expression and for making sense of the world. Like many street and documentary photographers before me, I am sensitive to the human experience. As such, my photos are about the (often seemingly mundane) intricacies that I come across in my surroundings and the places I visit. I combine color with black-and-white images and often abstract my subjects. All my photos are candid. Importantly, the experience of moving countries as a young adult had a lasting influence on me – this is frequently reflected in my images. *Gergő's Phlog* is the corner of the internet where I publish my photos.
